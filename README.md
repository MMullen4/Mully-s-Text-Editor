User must install Render to view Mully'S Text Editor, and can install the program locally by clicking on the "Install" button or the link on the web page command line.

## Usage
User is presented with the JATE logo and several lines of text already filled.  Text is simply entered on each line.  When enter is pressed the cursor drops to the next line.  Deleting works the same way.  Text is stored within local storage.
